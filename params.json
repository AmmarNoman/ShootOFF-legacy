{"name":"ShootOFF","tagline":"An open source framework to enhance laser dry fire training.","body":"### Welcome to Project ShootOFF!\r\n\r\nTired of perfecting your shooting skills by repeatedly pulling a trigger on a gun loaded with snap caps? With ShootOFF and a laser trainer you can turn your [dry fire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_fire) practice into a realistic, effective, and fun training experience! ShootOFF turns your home into a safe, clean shooting range you can use any time you want.\r\n\r\n![ShootOFF using the Shoot for Score protocol.](http://i.imgur.com/27oCqUe.png)\r\n\r\nShootOFF is free, open source software* that enhances laser dry fire training by detecting your shots using a computer and a commodity webcam. Beyond detecting shots, you can enable one of our default training protocols or install new ones to cause ShootOFF to perform interesting operations with your shots. Training protocols range from games intended to keep laser dry firing fun to focused training exercises that make commonly recommended [training practices](http://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/2013/09/daniel-zimmerman/seven-suggestions-effective-dry-fire-practice/) more real and interactive.\r\n\r\nShootOFF is intended to be used with laser cartridges sold by companies like [Laser Ammo](https://www.laser-ammo.com/) and [LaserLyte](http://www.laserlyte.com/) and laser trainers such as SIRT sold by [NextLevel Training](http://nextleveltraining.com/). A more complete list of hardware for laser dry fire training is available on our wiki [here](https://github.com/phrack/ShootOFF/wiki/Laser-Dry-Fire-Hardware).\r\n\r\nThis project was started in response to the large number of expensive, unreliable, and primitive hardware products sold online to act as targets for laser dry fire training. Why buy new hardware when you can use hardware you already own with free software?\r\n\r\n*ShootOFF is free both in the sense that it doesn't cost money and in the sense that anyone can download its source code and do anything they want with it.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n* [Virtual targets](https://github.com/phrack/ShootOFF/wiki/Adding-A-Virtual-Target) you can overlay on top of physical targets you've hung on your wall that are visible on your webcam feed.\r\n  * Virtual targets are used by training protocols to detect exactly where your shot landed on the physical target.\r\n* The [target editor](https://github.com/phrack/ShootOFF/wiki/Creating-A-Virtual-Target) helps you create virtual targets for any target you print out to use.\r\n  * ShootOFF comes with a number of targets that are in the public domain or where we have been granted permission to use a target that is subject to a copyright. With the target editor you can use any target you want: don't be limited by our current selection!\r\n* Rich [configuration](https://github.com/phrack/ShootOFF/wiki/Configuration) options allow you to use ShootOFF with nearly any laser trainer in most reasonable lighting conditions.\r\n* Training protocols make dry fire training fun and more effective.\r\n* Our software is [free](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phrack/ShootOFF/master/LICENSE) as in no cost and free as in freedom: all of ShootOFF's code is provided free of charge to do anything you want with it.\r\n\r\n### Download\r\n\r\nThe current stable version of ShootOFF is version 1.3, see [what's new](https://github.com/phrack/ShootOFF/issues?q=milestone%3A%221.3+Code+Organization+and+Training+Protocol+Improvements%22).\r\n\r\nWindows users can download the current version of ShootOFF as a package where they can simply download a zip, unzip it, and double click an exe to start ShootOFF by downloading either the [32-bit](https://github.com/phrack/ShootOFF/releases/download/1.3-FINAL/shootoff-WINDOWS-1.3FINAL-32BIT.zip) or [64-bit](https://github.com/phrack/ShootOFF/releases/download/1.3-FINAL/shootoff-WINDOWS-1.3FINAL-64BIT.zip) version.\r\n\r\nLinux, Mac, and Windows users can download the most current version of ShootOFF by using the zip or tar links at the top left of this page. If you download one of these archives you must follow the [install](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phrack/ShootOFF/master/INSTALL) instructions.\r\n\r\n### Documentation and Troubleshooting\r\n\r\nWe work hard to ensure that our [wiki](https://github.com/phrack/ShootOFF/wiki) is constantly up to date with the latest information for using, configuring, and troubleshooting the current version of ShootOFF. Please turn to the [FAQ](https://github.com/phrack/ShootOFF/wiki/FAQ) if you have any questions. If you have a suggestion or a problem that isn't addressed on the wiki please either email project.shootoff@gmail.com or open a new issue on our GitHub [issue tracker](https://github.com/phrack/ShootOFF/issues).\r\n\r\n### Contributing\r\n\r\nWe are always willing to accept code contributions on our GitHub [repository](https://github.com/phrack/ShootOFF). Please feel free to email project.shootoff@gmail.com or open an issue to discuss a feature you'd like to or are implementing.\r\n\r\nIf you do not know how to write software, we are always looking for help in the art department ([icons](https://github.com/phrack/ShootOFF/issues/10), graphics for the program and website, etc.). We can also always use help in advertising ShootOFF: tell a friend about the project, help a relative set-up ShootOFF, or post about your experience with the project on your favorite forum! \r\n\r\nWe do not accept monetary donations at this time. We suggest donating to [Project Appleseed](http://www.appleseedinfo.org/) or your local civil rights organization instead. If you make a donation out of gratitude for this project, please make us feel good by letting us know! ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
