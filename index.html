<a name="welcome-to-project-shootoff" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-project-shootoff"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to Project ShootOFF!</h3>

<p>Tired of perfecting your shooting skills by repeatedly pulling a trigger on a gun loaded with snap caps? With ShootOFF and a laser trainer you can turn your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_fire">dry fire</a> practice into a realistic, effective, and fun training experience! ShootOFF turns your home into a safe, clean shooting range you can use any time you want.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/27oCqUe.png" alt="ShootOFF using the Shoot for Score protocol."></p>

<p>ShootOFF is free, open source software* that enhances laser dry fire training by detecting your shots using a computer and a commodity webcam. Beyond detecting shots, you can enable one of our default training protocols or install new ones to cause ShootOFF to perform interesting operations with your shots. Training protocols range from games intended to keep laser dry firing fun to focused training exercises that make commonly recommended <a href="http://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/2013/09/daniel-zimmerman/seven-suggestions-effective-dry-fire-practice/">training practices</a> more real and interactive.</p>

<p>ShootOFF is intended to be used with laser cartridges sold by companies like <a href="https://www.laser-ammo.com/">Laser Ammo</a> and <a href="http://www.laserlyte.com/">LaserLyte</a> and laser trainers such as SIRT sold by <a href="http://nextleveltraining.com/">NextLevel Training</a>. A more complete list of hardware for laser dry fire training is available on our wiki <a href="https://github.com/phrack/ShootOFF/wiki/Laser-Dry-Fire-Hardware">here</a>.</p>

<p>This project was started in response to the large number of expensive, unreliable, and primitive hardware products sold online to act as targets for laser dry fire training. Why buy new hardware when you can use hardware you already own with free software?</p>

<p>*ShootOFF is free both in the sense that it doesn't cost money and in the sense that anyone can download its source code and do anything they want with it.</p>
